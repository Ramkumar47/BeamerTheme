# BeamerTheme
My custom beamer theme for LaTeX presentation

## instructions
1) Place the \*.sty files in the presentation folder
2) include the theme in the presentation by issuing command
> \usetheme{RK}
3) Then compile

## theme generation details
This theme was made by customizing the existing "default.sty" theme files.
Here, only the files that were modified was given and they are sufficient
to induce the new theme on to the presentation. Rest details will be taken
from the default theme files on the system.

If any more changes are to be done on, say font, then the corresponding
file named as beamerfontthemeRK.sty has to be modified and added in here.
